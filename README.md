## Dandruff Storyboard Prompts

Production-ready storyboard prompts for an 11-frame dandruff awareness sequence. Each prompt is optimized for generating visuals without any on-screen text so an existing voiceover or script can drive the narrative.

### Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the prompt library.

- `npm run build` – Generate the production build with Next.js.
- `npm run start` – Serve the production build.

### Notes

- Tailwind CSS powers styling with a gradient-driven presentation layer.
- Each card includes a copy-to-clipboard action for quick export into your favorite image generation workflow.
